# Sensortag DMX

Control your DMX light with a TI Sensortag. 


## Hardware Info

Developed with TI CC2541 SensorTag Dev Kit via sensortag node library.


## Hints

Maybe replace bluetooth-hci-socket directory in node_modules by @abandonware/bluetooth-hci-socket -> copy their directory to root of node_modules if installation of original bluetooth-hci-socket dependency fails... 

Or use older node version with e.g. docker (node 8 should work maybe)


Run scripts as root on linux...
