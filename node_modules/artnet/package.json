Unchanged data is refreshed every ~4s.\n\n## Options\n\n  * host (Default ```\"255.255.255.255\"```)\n  * port (Default ```6454```)\n  * refresh (millisecond interval for sending unchanged data to the Art-Net node. Default ```4000```)\n  * iface (optional string IP address - bind udp socket to specific network interface)\n\n## Methods\n\n#### **set(** [ [ *uint15* **universe** , ] *uint9* **channel** , ] *uint8* **value** [ , *function(err, res)* **callback** ] **)**\n#### **set(** [ [ *uint15* **universe** , ] *uint9* **channel** , ] *array[uint8]* **values** [ , *function(err, res)* **callback** ] **)**\n\n\nEvery parameter except the value(s) is optional. If you supply a universe you need to supply the channel also.\nDefaults: universe = 0, channel = 1\n\nCallback is called with (error, response) params.\nIf error and response are null data remained unchanged and therefore nothing has been sent.\n\n\n#### **close( )**\nCloses the connection and stops the send interval.\n\n\n# Further Reading\n\n* [Art-Net protocol specification](http://www.artisticlicence.com/WebSiteMaster/User%20Guides/art-net.pdf)\n\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014, 2015 hobbyquaker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
